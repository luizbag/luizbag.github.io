I've been a software developer for almost 18 years, doing mostly back-end stuff with C#. For the last 3 years I have also began to use Azure Cloud resources in some projects. I wouldn't call myself a cloud specialist, but a connoisseur. I have to admit that I'm a bit tired of working with the same thing over and over again and I need a fresh and new perspective to keep myself up and running for another 18 years.

Many nodejs and front-end opportunities have come up on my LinkedIn network and it would be nice to have some experience on that. Having said that, I would also like to remind myself that I'm a back-end guy and know little to nothing about front-end development. Nevertheless, I'd like to try.

So, let's start with some Typescript and React learning, shall we?
